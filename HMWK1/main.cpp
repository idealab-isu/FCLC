// Question 1 - Chapter 2 - 19, 24, 25, 28

// (Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard and prints the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of these numbers.
// The screen dialog should appear as follows:
//Input three different integers: 13 27 14
//Sum is 54
//Average is 18
//Product is 4914
//Smallest is 13
//Largest is 27

// Write a program that inputs a five-digit integer, separates the integer into its digits and prints them separated by three spaces each. [Hint: Use the integer division and modulus operators.] For example, if the user types in 42339, the program should print:
