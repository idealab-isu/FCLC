// By James Afful

// Question 1 - Chapter 2 - 19, 24, 25, 28

// (Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard and prints the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of these numbers.
// The screen dialog should appear as follows:
//Input three different integers: 13 27 14
//Sum is 54
//Average is 18
//Product is 4914
//Smallest is 13
//Largest is 27

    // Question 24
    // Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints whether itâ€™s odd or even. [Hint: Use the modulus operator. An even number is a multiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided by 2.]

    if (odd <= 0)
        cout << "The number is even" << endl;
    else
        cout << "The number is odd" << endl;



    // Question 25
    //Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and prints if the first is a multiple of the second. [Hint: Use the modulus operator.]

// Question 28
// Write a program that inputs a five-digit integer, separates the integer into its digits and prints them separated by three spaces each. [Hint: Use the integer division and modulus operators.] For example, if the user types in 42339, the program should print:
//[4   2   3   3   9]
